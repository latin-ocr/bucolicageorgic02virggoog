195. Ulcae: Pulli! masaga Servius cites Asconius Pedianus, as
having heard-Virgil himself sa that ha had deamat tc punto the
critice, “grammaticis crucem ‘ec ;” and that it wes an allusion to
ona celius, an extravagant man, who, after wasting his substance, reu
at his daath just so much land, his own property, as hie body covered. ,

Ι awcll, into which whoever descende, and looks upwardp‚ willl discover,

of the sky, the breadth of the well at thc top, and no more. Cerda

The Grecian leaders are by Homer styled hings.

110. Anecroa: the judgo, leaving the contest undeoided, and coni-
plimenting ths contending parties as each meriting a princ, seems to
'express an opinion, thot n similar prise would bc due to any other

cess . ¹
