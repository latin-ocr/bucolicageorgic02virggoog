umviri, Mark Antony, Lepidus, and Caesar Octavianus, afterwards
Augustus, these three agreed to confiscate, for the benefit ef their
troops, all the landed estates of eighteen. Romancolonies. Early in
the 713th year of Rome, this oppressive plan was put in execution.
Among these devoted colonies was Cremona3 the inhabitants of which
were char ed with the crime of adlrerence to the party of Brutus arrd
Cassius. his territory vves found insufficient for the rapacity of the
soldieryto whom it was assigned, end that of Mantua was added, though*
no such delinquency was imputed to its inhabitants.

Among the persons thus driven from their possessione, as has beerr
stated in his lise, was Virgil ; who, having had his roperty restored by
Augustus, is here represented, under the name of ityrus, in quiet pos·
session of it. Meliboeus represents another Mantuen, who, aster his ,
expulsion, is driving his little flock before him, and approaching the
spot where Tityrus rs reclining. He commences the dialogue by ex·
ppessing lpils asltoniphment that Tityrus, is thus at his ease, exempt from
