These vvere among the first considerations in publishing this
edition of Virgil It was believed, also, that a more correct tert
than any in common use might be put into the hands of learncrs,
by publishing in n ular form that which is the result of tha
combined labours o eyne, Heinsius, Burmann, Wakefield, and
others. Such is the text now offered to the youthfhl student of
Virgil. It is substantially Heyne's, which is undoubtedly the most
perfect text extant, but with such slight variations as a careful
· collation of the abovementioned authorities seemed to recom-
mend. It is printed from Didot's stereotype edition. And it is
confidently believed, should any instructers examine thework‚
who have hitherto been confined to the use of the Delphin text,
' that thegr will in this find many perplexities and stumblingblocks

remove .

ln preparing the Notes, free use has been made of all the
materials within the editor's resch. ln all cases where it could
consistently be done, the autliority has been given, except where
the notes of ΜΓ. Valpy’s edition have been adopted. These,
as his own remarks are frequently blended with other authorities,
have not been particularly designated. The notes of the learned
I. H. Voss were first made English for that edition, to which
notes this is likewisc indebted. The notes are explanatory of
the text, and not designed to supersede the use of the Classical
Dictionary3 which should never be out of the student’s reach.
In the vast variety of materiale presented, it has been found dif-
ficult to be sufficiently conciso. For it is easy to say much upon
Virgil, but difficult to say a little to the point. Bo s will not
voluntarily read long notes, even in their vernae ar tongue3
much less in n foreign languoge. But, when embarrassed, they
will seek relies from note's, if they are short.

As no boy should be permitted to read Virgil without being
able to scan every verse before he reads it, it was thought advis-
able to subjoin a list of the most difficult verses with the method

=of scanning each3 as this will save the teacher -from frequent
interruptione while the student is preparing for recitation. The

authority ofDr. Carey hasbeen followed in the Metrical Key.
A few questions have also been added, at the suggestion of some
of our most respectable instrhctcrs, which may expedite the la-
bour of the toacher in ascertaining whether the pupil has con-
sulted his notes and his Classical Dictionnry, and lead to a more
colqnected qqid definite view of the subject than the pupil would
ot erwiseo tain.
