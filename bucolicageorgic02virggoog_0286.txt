but succeeded in meeting the emperor at Atheus on his return.-
His benith, however, continued to decline. He was taken ill at
Megara, but insisted on being removed to Italy. He landed at
Brundusium, where he died a few days aster, on the twenty-
second of September, in the fifty-first year of his age, and nine-
teen years before Christ. His body was conveyed to Naples at
his own request‚ and interred within two miles of the city, on
the rond leading to Puteoli, where his tomb is to bc seen atthis

the poem to Tucca and Varus, with directions to revise and
erase whatever they saw fit, but expressly forbade their adding
any thing, even to the unfinishcd verses. This is probably the

plexion swarthy‚ and his constitution sickly. He was exceedingly
temperate, and paid little attention to dress; was modest and

was more than Virgil would allow. He accordingly wrote the
distich again, and placed under it the following:
