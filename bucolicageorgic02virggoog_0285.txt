1 him to Augustus. The emperor from that time beeanm hia pa-

tron and friend. He caused the poet’s lands tobe restored to
him, as will be seen hereaster by the notes to the first Eelogue,
which was written in grateful aoknowledgement of this favour.
'l'he ten Bueolies were written in about three years. Duria the
eivil war, agriculture had been almost entirely neglectad in taly,
and the eountry exlribited a most desolate and appalling specta·
ele. The necessarias of life were wanting; the people, in their
misery‚ threw the blame on Caesar, and the only way to save the
staltp fppm ruin, seemed to be to turn the attention of the people
to us andry.

Maecenas, knowing the talenta, and the various aud extensive
learning ol' virgil, applied tobim atthis orisisto aid in the ae·
eomplishment of this object Virgil immediately began hia
Georgica. The result was the productiori of the most beautifirh
finished‚ and usel'ul work ol' the age3 or perhaps of an age.
Tho effect was complete. The barren plain became a 'thu
field3 the hilis, besore naked, were elad in the rieh foliage of the
vine and the olive; aud the face of Italy once more assumed the
look ofhealtlr and of happiness. Alter a respits of several ears,
when turned of forty, Virgil began in earnest to write the eid3
though from his allusion in the sixth Eelogue‚ οιιπιοοιιιηιιιιιςιο,
deo„ it would seem he had done something towards the plan of
this poem muoh earlier.

lt is thought that the AEneid was begun at the nequest of Au·

· gustus. Be this as it may, it is pretty evident‚ while the poet

ibiibi illiti{libidlillttltlitttlihflhlz
means to describe the amiable qualities of his illustrious patron.
In the sixth book he attem ts to portray the virtues, and to la·
ment the untimely sate, olP Marcellus, the son of Octavia, hals·
sister os Augustus. This interesting outh was pabliclyeeknowl-
edged by his uncle as his intended successor to the imperial
throne; but died deeply lamented ot the eof eighteen. By

muoh entreaty, Augustus prevailed on Virgii to rpppat this pert
of his emto himinthe presence of Octavia en heeom·
men the verse, “Onera” &o Octavia burst into tears3 and, -
as he went on her agitation continued till he earne to the affeet-
ing words, “lh Marcellae eriess’ when she swoonedt Augustus
himself became much affected, and Virgil retired. On harre·
eovery‚ Octavia ordered ten sestertia, about three hundred and

-nine dollars, to be paid to the poet for eaeh verse referring
to er son. Virgil had spent seven years on the six booles then
written. In about four years more he finished the twelve booles,
and intended to revise and correct the whole at his totone, aad
then to devote the remainder of his days to philoso hy. But he
was not permitted to put the finishing hand to is immortel
testimony of his genius. Aster labouring eleven years u n the
AEneid‚ Virgil prepared to attend Augustus on his e “ 'on in

the Ean, intending the revision of his poem should be for ,⁸ 101.
