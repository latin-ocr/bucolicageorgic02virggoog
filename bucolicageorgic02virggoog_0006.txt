’ PREFACE.

——-

Ir any one cause has operated more than every other to pre·
vent young meri from acquiring a free and eas manner of read·
ing the Latin poete, it unquestionably is the iiabit of using an
orda of construction, oran interpretation. The use of these
’.· perniciore helps not only preventa those who rely on them from
ever acquiring the power of reading with ease and pleasure witb-
out them, but it is utterly subversive of one of the priucipal
’ objects of studying the language, that mental discipline which
is acquired by the practice of critical and exact analysis. This
salutary influence, the use of an order or of an interpretation ,
effectually couuteracts.

The student will hardly take the pains of diseutangling an
intricate sentence when tho work is done to his hand, nor will
the test of grammatical construction or of prosody be applied,
when a glauce at the interpretation will remove all doubts. The
habit of thus referring to the judgment of others soon becomes
settled3 while that of analysing is never formed, nor the disci·
pline of mind aequired‚ which it is suited to effect. Resides
this, the habit of using these unnecessary aids provents that feeling
of sels-reliance which successful efforts alone can secure. '

To this cause we must attribute the fact, that so few among .
our educated men read the Latin poets with ease or pleasure.
. .But if the habit of reading independently of foreign assistance bc
once formed, the want of such assistance is not felt. Itis found
b experiente that boys, who have beon taught in this way, read
lhtraee and Juvenal as readily as they do Cicero and Tacitus3
and even with more confidence ; since in poetry they are furnisb-
ed by prosody with an unerring test for resolving many doubts,
while rn-prose they have no such aid. ⁴ .

These are not new views. Books firrnislred with these auxil'
'iarios are going out of use in the best schools in forei u coun-
