Bathyllus was uested to completa the versos, but tm 'm
able to do it. Virg' then wrote tham out thus:
llos ego versiculos leci, tulit alter honum.
Sievos movebis nidificatis aves '
Sic vos non tobia vellera tertis oves.

Sic voa non vobis mellificatis
Sic voanon vobis leniremus vet.

And thereby proved himself the author of the disueh, to the no
atnall annoyauco of Bathyllus, who asterwards heom the aab·
J'ect os much ridicule.

As virgil was one os the most benevolent and dnuous men of
the age, so he lived beloved, and died universali lameritod. Just
before his death, heissaid to have written for ’ lfthis very
utodest and expressive epitaph:

· Mantua me genuit ι Calabri rapuere ι tenet nunc
Parthenope : cecini pascua, rura,ducea

Notwithstanding the pra-eminent natural endowments of Vtr-
gil, he unquestionably owed much to circumstances, andtilo age
tn which he lived. lle flourished in the brightest era of Roman
literature. Several distinguished scholare and men'of genita
had inunediately preceded him, and he was cotem rary with
Nepos, Sallust, Livy, Pro ttius, Tibullus, Ovid, lignea, aad
thdrus. With several o these he lived in habita of parmai
mpppcryppglmlippppzlpphoml purity of his writinga no lens than
the elegance and exquisite polish of hir style, render tha vorke
of Virgil, above all others of the age, suitable for the study and
contemplation of youth.
